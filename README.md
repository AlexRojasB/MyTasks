# MyTask

A Xamarin.Forms version of the [Filter Menu](https://dribbble.com/shots/1956586-Filter-Menu) design by Anton Aheichanka to prove you can create **goodlooking UI** with Xamarin.Forms.

<img src="images/forms-tasks.gif" Width="300" /> 

The sample is available for two platforms:

- iOS
- Android

_NOTE: This sample has been done just for fun and with the goal of recreating a goodlooking UI in Xamarin.Forms. It is not a real task application._
